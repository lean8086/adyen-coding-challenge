# Adyen code challenge

For the Adyen coding challenge we want you to create a web application. We expect you to spend a maximum of 3-4
hours on this assignment. This means you will have to make decisions on what to focus on. In general, we value
code quality and completeness over the number of features added to the application.

## Requirements

- You are free to choose any framework
- Build a web application that uses the Foursquare API (do not use any external API wrapper libraries)
- Get the user location and show a list of available venues
- Decide which venues and details are relevant to the user
- You have freedom to develop the UI/UX of the application
- Submit the code and share the link to the repository with us (e.g., GitHub, BitBucket,â€¦).
- Optional: give the user the ability to adjust some search parameters (e.g. location, radius, venue types)

## What are we looking for

We will check the code quality, application architecture, user interface and user experience decisions.
